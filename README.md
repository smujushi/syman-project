# syman-project

The Syman Project aims to create interactive play. Bringing the classic Simon game to a modern, large scale, multi-player, platform. Each round will display 10 levels of patterns increasing in difficulty. Players are challenged to repeat the pattern of each level and are awarded points for completing the pattern in each level and bonuses for speed.
